DonorsChoose.org connects willing donors to teachers who need funding for school projects, field trips, and other educational pursuits. We have built a mobile “dashboard” for teachers who are raising money through DonorsChoose. The app allows teachers to quickly browse through and access real time information on their current proposals, receive notifications about donations, respond to donor messages, write thank you notes, and share photos of their students making the most of the donated materials or experience.

- API class to retrieve information from the Donors Choose public API.
- Local datastore using singleton pattern
- Parse backend with a RESTful API architecture used to simulate the DonorsChoose private API data
- Push notifications.
- Chat log, using CoreGraphics to draw chat bubbles around each message.
- UIImagePickerViewController utilized to incorporate the camera and a photo management system directly in the app
